# Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python

These are codes I worked on during reading the book: "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python" by Brad Miller and David Ranum.

Link to the online and interactive version of the book:

This is a great book to dive into Python and become familiar with the basics of data structures. Thereafter, you should be able to solve Leetcode problems and pass the data "structures and algorithm" section of data science interviews.
